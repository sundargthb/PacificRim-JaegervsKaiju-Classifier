# Project Pacific Rim: Jaeger vs Kaiju Classifier

My 5 yo son and I are fans of the movie franchise Pacific Rim.  On a daily basis I (the Kaiju) am getting thrown around by him (Gipsy Avenger). 

As I tried explaining him what I was working on (designing a classifier and have the 'computer take a quiz'), “Dad, can it say whether this is an Jaeger or a Kaiju ?”.   “Ok buddy, Why not”. Completed the classification and was excited to show him. But Ofcourse… the end result did not satisfy him as he wanted the code to classify types of Jaegers and Kaijus, for which I need a lot more labelled data.  This was fun anyway.

I have not uploaded the images that I have used to train and test this model as I am not sure it would agree with the Github policy. Sorry. Please upload your own images into the train and test folders and edit this model accordingly.
